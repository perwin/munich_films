# munich_films

This is a bare-bones Python script which fetches the current "Original
Version" Munich film schedule from
[artechock.de](http://www.artechock.de/film/muenchen/film.htm) and saves
it in simplified text-file form. (By default, only the non-German films are extracted.)


## Requirements:
This is meant to be run under Python 3 (with minor fixes could probably
run under Python 2 as well).

In addition, the following external packages/modules are required:

- Beautiful Soup v4.x ("pip install beautifulsoup4")
- requests v2.x ("pip install requests")
